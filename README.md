# Hello everybody!

## About me
✌You are on the Tuw1s profile, I will upload some of my repos here, also with study to consolidate the material😌<br/>

I am 15 years old. Doing front-end for about 1 year (beginner).
I am thinking of becoming a full-stack developer in general, because I have delved into the web very deeply (yes, it's easy to say what to do, but it's worth a try)
I hope to find a partner with the same interests as mine.<br/>
And yes, my native language is Russian, so I use a translator :D<br/>
